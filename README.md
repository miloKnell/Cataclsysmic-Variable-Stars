# Cataclsysmic Variable Stars
This is the github page for the STEM Institute research team, we are trying to do period analysis of cataclysmic variable stars using fourier transformations.

The raw data is pickled as a list in both.pkl, and is available in a list of csv files. The data in the csvs is from both CBA and Ulwitz.
